Content creation is hard. 

For years I dreamt of being a youtuber, just like any other kid in my generation. However, in retrospect, I was never fully immersed into it. I have heard stories of the likes of Mr. Beast and Technoblade, whose obsession with the platform drove them to create numerous strategies with the hope of one day achieving their dream. I particularly remember the million subscriber video where **Technoblade** talked about he tried a lot of different things and always considered the impact his actions would have in his YouTube performance. 


I just never had that drive to spend all my free time in something like that. I did try with my Minecraft channel at some point. However, I quickly lost motivation when the results were not those I expected. So I gave up for a while, until the pandemic gave me some free time to try it again. This time things were a little bit better, more subscribers, more views, but still the lack of grow or fulfillment from the created content drove me away. 

So, I was once again lost. 

Then something changed. I was invited to participate in a project that had been going on for a couple of years. **errordesiSTEMa.oficial**. It was a STEM podcast with weekly episodes during the semester, where my teammates and I talked about our experiences in FIRST robotics and more. I really enjoyed being able to express myself in that format, and to create content related to the passion I discovered within robotics. *Scouting*. 

I created some short videos where I explained some statistics of the most recent events that were held that year. They "exploded", in terms of my previous performance. I found joy in that, and kept going for almost 3 years. 

However... In the end situations led me to leave the project while pursuing my new interests and life objectives. I do not regret pursuing these new found goals. As I have been relentlessly working towards them. Nonetheless, I still want to create content... in some way or another. 

Maybe is the remnants of the past. Or my ego. Or something else. 

I want to create something I am proud of and to enjoy myself doing that. 

Currently I am living the first big change in my life. Moving to another state for a 6 month on-site internship in what has quickly become my dream company. 

I have had may ideas in the past, but even now I find myself lost within the possibilities of what I could create content about. The only constant I find within all the mess, is that I really want to have a podcast. 

So maybe I'll do that. A podcast on my interests and my desire to know more about the world. 

I'll take some time to brainstorm some ideas. I'll come back once I have some better understanding on what is that I wish to achieve with this, probably, naive dream of mine.
